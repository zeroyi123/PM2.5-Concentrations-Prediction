# PM2.5-Concentrations-Prediction
PM2.5 Concentrations Prediction Using the FSR-MSAGRU model
The project contains three folders: Dataset, Data Processing, and FSR-MSAGRU Model Framework.
1.The dataset contains the raw data and the extracted experimental dataset.
2.The Data Processing folder mainly includes the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using Loess data decomposition and feature space reconstruction of the decomposition results.
3.The FSR-MSAGRU Model folder contains the implementation process of the FSR-MSAGRU model.
